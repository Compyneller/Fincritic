          You need to be careful before participating in the forex market. Do
          not invest money you cannot afford to lose or are unable to handle
          risk. The most important thing you should consider carefully is your
          objective of the investment, experience level, market risk &
          volatility.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are chances of high risk in any off-exchange foreign exchange
          transaction, including, but not restricted to, leverage, market
          volatility, reliability, and limited regulatory protection that may
          significantly affect the liquidity or price of a currency or currency
          pair.

          There are risks involved while using an internet-based trading system
          including, but not restricted to, the failure of software, hardware
          and internet network. FINCRITIC is not responsible for any kind of

          The leveraged nature of forex trading can work for you or maybe
          against you depending upon the market movement that will have an
          equally proportional effect on your invested funds. The possibility
          states that you could bear a total loss of initial margin funds and to
          maintain your position you need to deposit additional funds. If in any
          case, you fail to meet any margin funds requirement, you will be
          responsible for any resulting losses and your position may be
          liquidated.
