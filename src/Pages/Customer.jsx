      <p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>
        We provide services for trading derivative financial contracts. Our
        contracts are traded on a margin or leverage basis, a type of trading
        which carries a high degree of risk to your capital. The price of the
        contract you make with us may change quickly and your profits and losses
        may be more than the amount of your investment or deposit. If you do not
        hold sufficient funds to meet your margin requirements, then we may
        close your open positions immediately and without notice. Please read
        the Risk Warning Notice carefully to understand the risks of trading on
        a margin or leverage basis. You should not deal in our contracts unless
        you understand and accept the risks of margin trading. Trading in these
        products may not be suitable for everyone.

          <li>Margin requirement</li>
        </strong>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Before you place a Trade which creates an open position you must
            ensure that your Trading resource is sufficient to cover the margin
            requirement in respect of that open position. If your Trading
            resource is less than the margin requirement for the open Position
            you wish to create, we may reject your Trade.
          </li>
          <li>
            The margin requirement for an open Position is calculated using the
            margin Factor for the relevant market. margin Factors may be
            expressed as a percentage, number or other form applicable to the
            nature of the market. The margin requirement may increase or
            decrease at any time until the open Position is closed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Margin Factors for each market are stated in the market Information.
            Unless otherwise stated in our Notices and Policies with respect to
            third party trading platforms, margin Factors change. Changes to a
            margin Factor will increase or decrease your margin requirement. For
            margin Factors expressed as a percentage and all open Positions
            subject to Orders aware margin, the margin requirement may change as
            Our Price for the relevant market changes. margin requirement may
            also be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Base
            Currency and the currency of any open Position.
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-standard margin requirements may apply for the following:
            <ul>
              <li>
                When you are holding positions in two or more markets in the
                same Underlying Instrument;
              </li>
              <li>
                Trades which have an attached Stop Loss Order in markets where
                Orders aware margining is available
              </li>
              <li>When a margin Multiplier is applied</li>
              <li>
                When the quantity of a Trade is greater than our maximum

            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Orders aware margin offers the potential to reduce the margin
            requirement for open Positions in certain markets which are subject
            to a Stop Loss Order or a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. Orders aware
            margin is available for a limited range of markets and details of
            its availability is provided in the market Information.

            requirements at any time.

            We may apply a margin Multiplier to all open Positions placed in

            in a change to the margin requirement for any open Positions for the

            Your Total margin will be the aggregate of all margin requirements

        </strong>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Introduction- We aim to identify and prevent conflicts of interest
            which may arise between us and our clients, and between one client
            and another, in order to avoid any adverse effect on our clients.
            This Conflicts of Interest Policy (the “Policy”) sets out
            procedures, practices and controls in place to achieve this. This
            Policy applies to all officers, directors (whether Executive or
            Non-Executive), employees and any persons directly or indirectly
            linked to us (together “Personnel”) and refers to interactions with
            all of our clients. Unless separately defined in this Policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personal account dealing- All Personnel are bound by the
            requirements of our Personal account Dealing Policy. All
            transactions undertaken by Personnel are actively monitored by our
            Compliance Department.
          </li>
          <li>
            Production of investment research/research recommendation- We do not
            produce investment research or provide investment research
            recommendations.
          </li>
          <li>
            “Need to Know” policy- Where Personnel are in possession of
            confidential or inside information such as information relating to a
            client’s Trade, Personnel may not disclose such information to
            another party without ensuring that:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>There is a clear need-to-know on the part of the recipient;</li>
            <li>The procedures set out in this Policy are adhered to;</li>
            <li>
              Where the information relates to a client, the information
              transfer is in accordance with the best interests of the client;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              The recipient is made aware of the requirement to treat the
              information as confidential. Only information required for the
              intended use may be disclosed and the receiving individual is then
              bound by the same restrictions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Gifts and inducements- Personnel may not solicit or accept any gift
            or inducement which may influence their independence or business
            judgment or which could create a conflict with any duty owed to us
            or our clients. This restriction does not include special promotions
            on products and services which have been agreed by our senior
            management, nor does it cover corporate gifts and hospitality which
            are considered to be incidental to the interests of our client.
          </li>
          <li>
            Restriction on access to information/electronic data- The access to
            computer drives and to files located within drives is restricted by
            the use of passwords and user IDs. Computers are automatically
            locked if unattended for a short period. In addition, Personnel are
            reminded of the importance of data protection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whistleblowing Policy- We are committed to ensuring that malpractice
            is prevented and, if it should arise, to deal with it immediately.
            Employees are informed as to whom they can and should report public
            interest issues in the Company’s Whistleblowing Policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disclosure policy- We believe that our internal policies and
            procedures, systems and controls, generally mitigate the risk of any
            conflict of interest arising, either between us and our client or
            between two or more of our clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            Policy Review- We regularly review our Conflicts of Interest Policy
            to ensure that it covers conflicts that can be reasonably expected
            to arise within the course of our business. Any significant
            amendments to this Policy must be approved by our senior management.
